## Notable changes in this release

The following table covers notable changes in v0.56.0. Further information about these changes can be found in the [user documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.56/).

<td valign="top">The <tt>getCpuLoad()</tt> method now collects two internal samples so that a valid CPU usage value can be returned instead of <tt>0</tt> return value on the first call.</td>
<td valign="top">All versions (All operating systems except z/OS&reg;)</td>
<td valign="top">The change in the <tt>getCpuLoad()</tt> method return value is applicable on all platforms except z/OS. On z/OS, the CPU load that is reported by the <tt>getCpuLoad</tt> method is obtained directly from the system control blocks, without the need to collect samples. The <tt>-XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility</tt> option has no effect on z/OS, and a valid CPU usage value is always returned whatever the setting of this option.

This modification also changes the <tt>-version</tt> output. For example, <tt>build openj9-0.56.0</tt> changes to <tt>build 11.0.29+7-openj9-0.56.0</tt>.<br>This change was initiated in the 0.55.0 release and it affects 0.56.0 and all future releases.</td>

<td valign="top">The default stack size for the main thread is a smaller platform-dependent value.</td>
<td valign="top">All</td>
<td valign="top">The main thread stack size was 1 MB in releases before 0.32. In the 0.32 release and later it was modified to a smaller
platform-dependent value, the same value as the <tt>-Xmso</tt> setting. The 0.33 release increased the default <tt>-Xmso</tt> stack size
on x64 platforms, but builds with OpenJDK 17 and later also require more stack space to run. These changes might result in a
<tt>java.lang.StackOverflowError: operating system stack overflow</tt>.</td>
<td valign="top">Use <tt>-Xmso</tt> to set the default stack size. See the default value by using <tt>-verbose:sizes</tt>.</td>
